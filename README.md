# Attendance Management System Using Face Recognition

## Overview

This project aims to develop an efficient and accurate Attendance Management System using face recognition technology. The system automates the attendance process, allowing teachers to add, update, and delete student data through a desktop application. The system captures 100 images per student for recognition, and during attendance, it displays a green rectangle for recognized students and a red rectangle with "Unknown" for unrecognized faces. The attendance data is automatically exported to an Excel sheet, and absent students receive automated emails.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- MongoDB
- OpenCV

## Tools used
- PyCharm
- MongoDB compass

## Project Features

- Teachers can manage student data (add, update, delete) through the desktop application.
- Face recognition captures 100 images per student for accurate attendance tracking.
- Real-time display of recognized and unrecognized faces during attendance.
- Automatic generation of an Excel sheet with attendance data upon turning off the camera.
- Automated emails sent to absent students based on their language preference.

## Project Objectives

1. Develop an attendance management system using face recognition for schools and colleges.
2. Automate the attendance-taking process to save time and improve accuracy.
3. Provide real-time attendance data for better tracking.
4. Identify and address attendance problems promptly.

## System Components

- Computer with a webcam
- Python programming language
- OpenCV library
- Database of known faces

## How It Works

1. Students stand in front of the webcam upon entering the classroom.
2. The system captures their faces and compares them to the database.
3. Recognized faces have their attendance marked; unrecognized faces are marked as absent.

## Reports and Analysis

The system generates reports on attendance, helping administrators track student attendance and identify frequent absentees.

## Advantages

- Automated attendance
- Real-time data
- Improved accuracy
- Increased security
- Reduced administrative workload
- Enhanced efficiency

## Conclusion

While face recognition systems offer numerous benefits, careful consideration of limitations is crucial for successful implementation. This system, despite its challenges, can significantly improve attendance management in educational institutions.
